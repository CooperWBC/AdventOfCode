Op Codes

1 = ADD

    Description : Opcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a
    third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions -
    the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third
    indicates the position at which the output should be stored.

    Example : For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values
    at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their
    sum.

2 = Multiply

    Description : Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead
    of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs
    are, not their values.

99 = HALT

    Description : 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt
